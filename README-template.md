## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS




### What I learned

In this project, I experimented with SASS, a CSS preprocessor that allows for more flexibility and functionality. I admit that my SASS skills are not very advanced, but I managed to apply some of the basic concepts and features that I learned.


### Continued development

Here, I want to share with you my learning goals for improving my web development skills. One of the areas that I am going to focus on is SASS, which is a powerful tool for writing and managing CSS code. SASS can help me create more efficient and maintainable stylesheets, and reduce the time and complexity of web design projects. Another area that I want to learn more about is the popular frontend frameworks and libraries, such as React. To use React effectively, I also need to work on my JavaScript skills, which are essential for frontend tasks. By improving my SASS, React, and JavaScript skills, I hope to become a better web developer and create more engaging and user-friendly websites.

### Useful resources
